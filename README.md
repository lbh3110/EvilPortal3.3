# EvilPortal3.3
New version of the EvilPortal module for Wifi Pineapple, forked from newbi3 (original version).

## New Features
1. After success connect, the portal redirects to a success.php file, with a custom message. The redirect, now is fixed.
2. HTTPS trafic now is blicked, I still working in an alternative to avoid block, and redirect to the portal.
